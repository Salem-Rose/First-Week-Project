  <h1> Hello! </h1>
  
  <p><strong>Welcome to my portfolio.</strong> I am currently in the Epicodus Coding Program online and just completed my first week of lessons. There were many concepts to cover the first week! Here's a list of names of the webpages:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Interior Decoroator Website</li>
    <li>Walrus</li>
    <li>Fido</li>
    <li>Box Model</li>
  </ol>

  <ul>
  <p><em>Click on any one of the links to see my projects:</em></p>
  <p><a href="interior-decorator-website.html">Interior Decorator Website</a></p>
  <p><a href="walrus.html">Walrus</a></p>
  <p><a href="fido.html">Fido</a></p>

  </ul>
  
  <p>About me</p>
  <p>I decided to take this class on programming because I want to learn how to write the language of computers. The world of tech is expected to grow and expand in the future. Check out <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>. It's a great school for learning web programming! Outside of class hours, I enjoy reading, hiking, and traveling.</p>
